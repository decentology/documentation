| **Blockchain**     | Blockchains are the underlying technology for the decentralized web.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Smart contract** | A smart contract is the code executed on a blockchain.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Dapp**           | A computer application that runs on a distributed computing system. If you’ve ever developed “serverless” apps on Azure or Amazon this is a similar concept.                                                 |
| **Solidity**       | An object-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts. It is used for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum. Solidity is similar to JavaScript. |
