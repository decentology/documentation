# Get Started!

### Understanding and Exploring the Hyperverse

* [Composing the Hyperverse](https://www.decentology.com/blog/composing-the-hyperverse) - We're building the future of decentralized apps on the Hyperverse. Learn more about our approach and how you can get involved.
* [Hyperverse Roadmap and FAQs](https://www.decentology.com/hyperverse)

### Understanding Dapps

Decentralized Apps, or dapps, are applications that run on the blockchain. Using a frontend interface and a smart contract, dapps value and access isn't controlled by a single person or entity. When we talk about web3, we're referring to dapps that run on the blockchain.

Learn about how you can get a dapp up and running quickly using Decentology's [DappStarter](../../).

### Build

If you're up for the challenge and want to submit your project for the Tinker category, there are two ways to get started with DappStarter.

* [Web App ](https://docs.decentology.com/create-your-dapp/dappstarter-web-app)- Build full-stack blockchain applications with DappStarter directly from your browser.&#x20;
* [CLI ](https://docs.decentology.com/create-your-dapp/dappstarter-cli)- Build full-stack blockchain applications with DappStarter directly from your terminal.&#x20;
