## What is included in my application?

### Smart contract code

You now have smart contract code that is highly commented for you to customize.

### Tests

Each smart contract block includes tests for your smart contract code.

### Web app

Every blockchain function has a corresponding action card that has a one-to-one correspondence to every smart contract function in your dapp. Action cards are labeled as either GET or POST, designated by the icon in the upper right corner of each action card.

### Server-side API

Also included is the code for a NodeJS server-side API for your blockchain app.
