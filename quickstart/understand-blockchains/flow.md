# Flow

## **Overview**

**Flow is a new smart contract-oriented blockchain currently in development by Dapper Labs.** It seeks to solve the scalability problem by introducing node specialization, without sacrificing decentralization and security.

A developer-friendly approach is one of Flow’s guiding principles. Built-in smart contract upgradability looks to make programmer’s life easier while still preserving the trust-free nature of decentralized blockchains. Secondly, Flow boasts a comparatively low time between submitting a transaction and it being recorded with certainty on the blockchain (finality). Lastly, built-in logging support makes smart contract auditing easier, without storing too much relevant data on the blockchain itself.

## **Language**

**Flow uses Cadence:**

* Inspired by Rust, Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript, and Solidity
* Resource-oriented ([learn more](https://medium.com/dapperlabs/resource-oriented-programming-bee4d69c8f8e))
* Statically typed

For more on Cadence, see [documentation](https://docs.onflow.org/docs/cadence).

## **For who?**

**For developers** willing to experiment in a relatively new environment in return for many innovative and useful features.
