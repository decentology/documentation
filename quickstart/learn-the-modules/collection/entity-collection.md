# Entity Collection

## Definition

**The Entity Collection module** provides developers with a way of adding, updating, and retrieving data using the UI Test Harness. A data entity consists of a title, numeric value, and a unique id. They can be retrieved by id, page, or creatorâ€™s account using action cards in the UI Test Harness, which in turn executes a function calling the smart contract level.

## Benefit&#x20;

* **On a basic level,** the methods allowed for by the Entity Collection module are similar to a REST API architecture, ensuring a smooth developer experience.
