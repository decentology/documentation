# Basin non-fungible token

## Definition

**NFT’s** differ from the usual fungible tokens (like an erc-20 token) in that they’re not interchangeable because of each token’s uniqueness. Secondly, they can’t be split into smaller units, making them indivisible. Thirdly, they’re non-uniform because each token has different characteristics.

The concept of non-fungible tokens gained significant traction with the creation of the ERC-721 standard and subsequent Cryptokitties’ launch (by the team behind Flow, Dapper Labs). Most often, non-fungible tokens serve as digital collectibles backed by the immutable and secure nature of blockchain.&#x20;

For more on NFT’s, see [the NFT Bible](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/).

## Benefits

* **Issuance of digital items **backed by the decentralized and secure nature of blockchain
* **Proving** both the uniqueness and ownership of a digital item is made possible, in a world dominated by replicable digital files, e.g. songs or books.&#x20;

## Example

**An online store** wants to introduce digital coupons for users to be rewarded with and which can be used to redeem items. The Non-fungible tokens module can be implemented in a Flow smart contract to create and distribute coupon NFT’s to customers. \
